# Product Requirements Document: SpecDrafter

---

## 1. Project Overview

**SpecDrafter** is an intelligent AI agent designed to streamline the software development lifecycle by automating the initial, critical phase of requirements gathering. The agent engages users in a structured, in-depth, conversational dialogue, progressively "drilling down" from a high-level vision to detailed specifications.

The primary goal is to produce a comprehensive, unambiguous, and developer-ready Product Requirements Document (PRD). This final output is specifically formatted to serve as a high-quality, "vibe-ready" prompt for AI-powered coding environments like Cursor and Firebase Studio, thereby bridging the gap between idea and implementation and ensuring a higher quality starting point for development. The key success metric for SpecDrafter will be the completeness and clarity of the generated PRD.

## 2. User Personas and Roles

### 2.1. The Vibe Coder

-   **Description:** The sole user of SpecDrafter. A "Vibe Coder" is a modern developer, project manager, or business analyst who leverages AI-powered tools to accelerate the development process. They are comfortable translating ideas into natural language prompts and expect the AI to handle the heavy lifting of code generation and project scaffolding.
-   **Goal:** To transform a raw application idea into a robust set of requirements with minimal friction. They need to trust that SpecDrafter will ask the right questions to cover all necessary functional, non-functional, and technical aspects, resulting in a document that enables them to start "vibe coding" immediately and effectively.

## 3. High-Level Features

-   **Guided Conversational Elicitation:** Leads the user through a multi-phase questionnaire to ensure all requirement categories are covered.
-   **Project Lifecycle Management:** Allows the user to create, save, and resume requirement sessions.
-   **Dynamic Conversation Control:** Provides the flexibility to switch topics on the fly using natural language.
-   **Interactive Review and Editing:** Enables the user to review all collected information and make corrections at any point.
-   **Targeted PRD Generation:** Compiles the entire conversation into a final, structured PRD tailored for a specific AI coding environment.

## 4. Detailed User Stories

-   **Project Initiation:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to start a new requirements project so that I can begin defining a new application from scratch."
-   **Session Management:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to save my current requirements session and resume it later so that I don't lose my progress and can continue at my own pace."
-   **Guided Elicitation:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to be guided through a structured series of questions so that I can ensure all aspects of the system requirements are covered systematically."
-   **Conversational Flexibility:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to be able to switch topics during the conversation so that I can add details as I think of them, without being locked into a rigid sequence."
-   **Inline Review and Correction:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to review and edit the collected requirements at any point so that I can correct misunderstandings and add missing details before the final document is created."
-   **Document Generation:** "As a Vibe Coder, I want to command SpecDrafter to generate the final PRD so that I can get a well-structured document ready for vibe coding."

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Conversational Engine
-   **Natural Language Control:** The user interacts with the system primarily through natural language prompts.
-   **Contextual Topic Switching:** The user can change the subject at any time (e.g., "Actually, let's talk about security"). The system will pause the current topic, address the new one, and then automatically return to the previous context.
-   **Ambiguity Resolution:** If a user's response is vague, the system will not simply accept it. It will attempt to clarify by rephrasing the question, breaking it into simpler steps, or providing examples of desired answers.
-   **Progress Tracking:** The system will provide feedback on the user's progress through the five phases of requirements gathering.

### 5.2. Project Lifecycle and Persistence
-   **Data Model:** For each project, the system must save:
    -   The entire conversation history.
    -   A versioned series of snapshots of the structured requirements.
-   **Project Identification:** A new project is assigned a unique ID. The system will later suggest a human-readable project name based on the content, which the user can accept or override.
-   **Data Persistence:** The conversation and a new requirements version are saved automatically upon every change.
-   **Project Resumption:** A returning user can load a project by selecting it from a list or searching by its ID or name.

### 5.3. Review and Edit
-   **Initiation:** A user can request to review the collected requirements via a natural language prompt (e.g., "Show me everything we have so far").
-   **Presentation:** The system will display a full, well-structured summary of the current requirements state.
-   **Editing:** Edits are performed using natural language (e.g., "Change the database to PostgreSQL"). The system should be capable of handling both specific and broad changes.
-   **Versioning:** A successful edit automatically creates a new, saved version of the requirements document, linked to that point in the conversation for full traceability.

### 5.4. Final PRD Generation
-   **Initiation:** Triggered by a natural language command (e.g., "Okay, let's generate the document").
-   **Format:** The output is a single, large Markdown file.
-   **Content:** The system automatically generates all PRD sections based on the gathered info.
-   **Targeting:** The user can specify a target environment ("Cursor" or "Firebase Studio") to allow the system to tailor the final output structure and prompts.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance:** The quality of the AI's reasoning and generation is the top priority. Response times of a few seconds are acceptable to achieve high-quality output.
-   **UI/UX:** The interface will be a clean, modern, web-based chat application. It must also support optional voice input and output.
-   **Reliability:** The system must be highly reliable. On crash or disconnect, it must restart and automatically load the last saved state to prevent any data loss.
-   **Scalability:** The system is designed for a single-user-per-instance model. There are no requirements for handling concurrent users.
-   **Model:** The system **must** use the Gemini 2.5 Pro model for all core reasoning and generation tasks to ensure the highest quality interaction.

## 7. Technical Specifications

-   **Backend:** Python with Flask or FastAPI.
-   **Frontend:** Node.js with Next.js and React.
-   **Database:** A local MongoDB instance for storing conversation histories and versioned requirements.
-   **LLM Integration:** Secure integration with the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API.
-   **Voice I/O:** Voice input and output will be handled via the Gemini API.
-   **Deployment:** The application should be architected to run either locally on a user's machine or be deployed as a hosted service on a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel for frontend, AWS/Google Cloud for backend).

## 8. UI/UX Guidelines

-   **Layout:** A minimalist, chat-centric interface. The conversation transcript should be the main focus of the UI.
-   **Componentization:** A sidebar could be used to display a list of saved projects and show the user's progress through the five requirement-gathering phases.
-   **Voice Feedback:** The UI must include clear visual indicators to show when the system is listening, processing, or speaking.
